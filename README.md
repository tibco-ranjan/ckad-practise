Recently I passed the CKAD exam with 92% marks on August 17, 2023, my certificate number is LF-pcd3oa7njo. 
This could only happen as I took the excellent CKAD course on Udemy @Mumshad Mannnambeth. 
The practice LAB, Lighting LAB, MOCK test exam and Kubernetes challenge really helped me to check my knowledge and understanding before the exam.

All Udemy and many other online trainting portals are free with my current organization so I don't have the idea of the cost of the courses. 
Please contact https://kodekloud.com/community/ for the details of the course.

I highly recomend to take the CAKD and CKA course from Kodekloud to pass these exams.

Here by I am sharing my practise excercises and notes which I done for this exam. 

The practice module provides deep insight of the different concpets asked in CAKD exam.

The essential PDF file and docs for examp "Things to remember", "HELM" is for the quick revision.


If you have any query or question, please write to me at tibco.ranjan@gmail.com.
