Question: Create a pod with an nginx container exposed on port 80. Add a busybox init container which downloads a page using "wget -O /work-dir/index.html http://neverssl.com/online". Make a volume of type emptyDir and mount it in both containers. For the nginx container, mount it on "/usr/share/nginx/html" and for the initcontainer, mount it on "/work-dir". When done, get the IP of the created pod and create a busybox pod and run "wget -O- IP"
